# Object Detection Using CNN 🚀

This repository contains the code, report, and presentation for my 6th-semester Minor Project on **Image Classification and Object Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**. The model is built, trained, and evaluated using the **CIFAR-10** dataset.

## 📂 Repository Contents

* **`object_detection_uisng_cnn_from_images.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, building the CNN model architecture, training, and evaluation.
* **`Project_Report_Object Detection Using CNN.pdf`**: The comprehensive project report detailing the methodology, network architecture, and final findings.
* **`6Th sem Minor Project_PPT.pdf`**: The presentation slides used for the project defense.
* **`confusion matrix.png`**: A visual representation of the model's classification accuracy.

## 📊 Dataset: CIFAR-10

The model is trained on the widely used [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html), which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images divided into 10 distinct classes (e.g., airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks).

## 📈 Results & Evaluation

Below is the confusion matrix generated after testing the model. It illustrates the model's performance, showing the true positive predictions versus misclassifications across all 10 categories.
